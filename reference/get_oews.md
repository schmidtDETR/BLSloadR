# Download Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) Data

This function downloads and joins together occupational employment and
wage data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics OEWS program. The data
includes employment and wage estimates by occupation and geographic
area. Note that OEWS is a large data set (over 6 million rows), so it
will require longer to download.

## Usage

``` r
get_oews(
  simplify_table = TRUE,
  suppress_warnings = TRUE,
  return_diagnostics = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- simplify_table:

  Logical. If TRUE (default), remove columns from the result that are
  internal BLS references or can be derived from other elements in the
  table.

- suppress_warnings:

  Logical. If TRUE (default), suppress individual download warnings and
  diagnostic messages for cleaner output during batch processing. If
  FALSE, returns the data and prints warnings and messages to the
  console.

- return_diagnostics:

  Logical. If TRUE, returns a bls_data_collection object with full
  diagnostics. If FALSE (default), returns just the data table.

## Value

By default, returns a data.table with OEWS data. If return_diagnostics =
TRUE, returns a bls_data_collection object containing data and
comprehensive diagnostics. The columns in the returned data frame when
\`simplify_table = TRUE\` are listed below. Unless otherwise specified,
all data is returned as a character string to preserve the value of
leading and trailing zeroes.

- series_id - The unique OEWS series identifier.

- year - The year to which the estimate refers. Because OEWS is not time
  series data, this is always the most recent year.

- value - Numeric. The value of the given data type, for the given area,
  in the given industry and occupation.

- seasonal - Whether or not the data is seasonally adjusted.

- areatype_code - Code representing the type of area (National ("N"),
  Statewide ("S"), or Local ("M")).

- industry_code - NAICS code of the industry.

- occupation_code - SOC code of the occupation. Description given by
  occupation_name.

- datatype_code - Lookup code for the data type of a given row.
  Description given by datatype_name.

- state_code - Two-digit FIPS code for the state.

- area_code - The unique OEWS code for a substate area. Description
  given by area_name.

- series_title - Descriptive title of the full series ID.

- occupation_name - The text description of the occupation.

- occupation_description - More detailed description of the tasks
  associated with the occupation.

- area_name - The text description of the area.

- datatype_name - The text description of the type of data represented
  by \`value\`.
