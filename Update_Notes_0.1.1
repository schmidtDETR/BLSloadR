Issue #1
Not all of the **.txt overview files has the same formatting for Section 2.  For example, the ce database has a number of lines that starts with an asterisk.
Also, BLS documentation may include incorrect file names. Change to: direct read of the HREF in the /**/ directory.

Issue #2
Some dates are quarterly (e.g. "ln" file).  Need to change date column when using simplify_table to parse the period column (A/Q/M) and use an appropriate date function.
