\title{Efficiently Extract and Cache Subsets of CPS (LN) Data}
\usage{
get_cps_subset(
  series_ids = NULL,
  characteristics = NULL,
  simplify_table = TRUE,
  cache = TRUE,
  cache_dir = NULL,
  suppress_warnings = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{series_ids}{Optional character vector of specific series IDs to extract.
If NULL, must provide characteristics. Can be combined with characteristics
to expand the query. Use \code{\link{explore_cps_series}} to discover
relevant series IDs.}

\item{characteristics}{Optional named list of characteristics to filter by
(e.g., `list(ages_code = "00", sexs_code = "1")`). Available characteristics
depend on the LN series structure and may include ages_code, sexs_code,
periodicity_code, and others found in the ln.series file. Use
\code{\link{explore_cps_characteristics}} to discover valid codes.}

\item{simplify_table}{Logical. If TRUE (default), removes internal code columns,
converts values to numeric, and creates a date column from year and period.
Also removes display_level, sort_sequence, selectable, and footnote_codes columns.}

\item{cache}{Logical. If TRUE (default), uses persistent local caching for both
the master data file and the extracted subsets. Cache validity is checked against
BLS server modification times to ensure data freshness.}

\item{cache_dir}{Optional character string specifying the directory for cached files.
If NULL, uses R's temporary directory via `tempdir()`. For persistent caching across
sessions, provide a permanent directory path.}

\item{suppress_warnings}{Logical. If TRUE, suppress individual download warnings.
Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A `bls_data_collection` object containing:
  \itemize{
    \item data: The requested subset with series metadata and mapping files joined
    \item download_diagnostics: Information about files accessed during extraction
    \item warnings: Any warnings generated during processing
    \item summary: Summary statistics about the data collection
  }
}
\description{
This function extracts specific series from the BLS Current Population Survey (LN) dataset
using intelligent caching to avoid redundant downloads and processing. It supports filtering
by exact series IDs or by demographic/economic characteristics.
}
\details{
The function uses a two-tier caching strategy:
\enumerate{
  \item Master file caching: The full ln.data.1.AllData file is downloaded once
        per session (or permanently if cache_dir is specified) and only
        re-downloaded when the BLS server indicates updates.
  \item Subset caching: Each unique combination of series_ids is cached separately
        using an MD5 hash. Subsets are invalidated if the master file is updated.
}

The function automatically joins relevant mapping files (e.g., ln.ages, ln.sexs)
based on the characteristics present in the requested series.
